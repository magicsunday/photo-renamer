# Improvement Tasks for Photo Renamer

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the Photo Renamer project. Each task is categorized and prioritized to help guide future development efforts.

## Architecture and Design

1. [ ] Implement a proper dependency injection container to manage service instantiation and dependencies
2. [ ] Extract file system operations into a dedicated service to improve testability and separation of concerns
3. [ ] Create interfaces for core components to allow for better abstraction and potential alternative implementations
4. [ ] Implement the Command pattern more consistently across all rename operations
5. [ ] Separate the CLI interface from the core business logic to allow for potential GUI implementations
6. [ ] Refactor the AbstractRenameCommand class to reduce its size and complexity (currently 697 lines)
7. [ ] Extract duplicate detection logic into a separate service
8. [ ] Implement a proper logging system instead of directly outputting to console

## Code Quality

9. [ ] Add comprehensive PHPDoc comments to all classes and methods
10. [ ] Implement strict type checking throughout the codebase
11. [ ] Reduce the complexity of methods in AbstractRenameCommand (some methods are too long and do too much)
12. [ ] Use more descriptive variable and method names
13. [ ] Add return type declarations to all methods
14. [ ] Implement value objects for domain concepts (e.g., FilePath, FileExtension)
15. [ ] Use more immutable objects to reduce side effects
16. [ ] Implement proper exception handling with custom exception classes
17. [ ] Remove commented-out code and unused methods

## Testing

18. [ ] Create the test directory structure as referenced in composer.json
19. [ ] Implement unit tests for all model classes
20. [ ] Implement integration tests for command classes
21. [ ] Add functional tests for end-to-end scenarios
22. [ ] Implement test fixtures for common file operations
23. [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
24. [ ] Add code coverage reporting
25. [ ] Implement mutation testing to ensure test quality
26. [ ] Create a test strategy document

## Documentation

27. [ ] Improve inline code documentation with more detailed explanations
28. [ ] Create a comprehensive API documentation
29. [ ] Add more examples to the README.md file
30. [ ] Create user guides for each command with detailed examples
31. [ ] Document the architecture and design decisions
32. [ ] Add a contributing guide for new developers
33. [ ] Create a changelog to track version changes
34. [ ] Add diagrams to illustrate the application flow

## Security

35. [ ] Implement input validation for all user inputs
36. [ ] Add file permission checks before operations
37. [ ] Implement proper error handling for security-related issues
38. [ ] Add checks for malicious file paths
39. [ ] Implement a secure way to handle sensitive EXIF data
40. [ ] Add a security policy document
41. [ ] Perform a security audit of dependencies

## Performance

42. [ ] Optimize file hash calculation for large files
43. [ ] Implement batch processing for large directories
44. [ ] Add progress reporting for long-running operations
45. [ ] Optimize memory usage when processing large collections of files
46. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed file metadata
47. [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
48. [ ] Optimize the duplicate detection algorithm
49. [ ] Implement parallel processing for CPU-intensive operations

## User Experience

50. [ ] Improve error messages to be more user-friendly
51. [ ] Add color coding to console output for better readability
52. [ ] Implement interactive mode for complex operations
53. [ ] Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations
54. [ ] Improve help text for all commands
55. [ ] Add a "preview" mode to show what would be renamed without making changes
56. [ ] Implement undo functionality for rename operations
57. [ ] Add support for configuration files to store common settings

## Internationalization and Localization

58. [ ] Extract all user-facing strings into language files
